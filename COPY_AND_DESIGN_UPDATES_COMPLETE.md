# Copy and Design Updates Complete

## Summary

Successfully implemented all requested copy changes and design tweaks across the LobbyThis homepage.

## Changes Made

### 1. Landing Page (Hero Section)

**Subheadline Updated:**
- **Old:** "Citizens funding real influence â€” organized, transparent, unstoppable."
- **New:** "Support the issues you care about most. Watch your money turn into speech, and power."

**Removed:** Animated scroll indicator (floating icon) that was touching the CTA button

### 2. How It Works Section

**Header Copy Updated:**
- **New:** "LobbyThis turns collective funding into political leverage. We're building a transparent, AI-powered firm to maximize influence and minimize overhead."

**Steps Updated:**
1. **Start a movement**
   - Icon: FileText (document)
   - Copy: "Write a short proposal for change and share it on LobbyThis."

2. **Spread the word**
   - Icon: Users (group of people)
   - Copy: "Invite supporters. More backers expands your influence."

3. **See the impact**
   - Icon: Eye (visibility/transparency)
   - Copy: "We share clear updates on strategies and actions taken toward your goal."

**Bottom Message Updated:**
- **Old:** "Simple. Transparent. Scalable. The future of influence is democratic again."
- **New:** "Make your voice hard to ignore. Coordinated funding that holds officials accountable between elections."

**Design Fix:**
- Connector line between boxes now uses `bg-copper/40` and `-z-10` to prevent orange blur
- Boxes have `z-10` to ensure they appear above the line cleanly
